Valid values are \"ws\" for WebSocket and \"wss\"\n *  for Secure WebSocket.\n *  So to connect to \"wss://CURRENT_HOSTNAME/xmpp-websocket\" you would call\n *\n *  > var conn = new Strophe.Connection(\"/xmpp-websocket/\", {protocol: \"wss\"});\n *\n *  Note that relative URLs _NOT_ starting with a \"/\" will also include the path\n *  of the current site.\n *\n *  Also because downgrading security is not permitted by browsers, when using\n *  relative URLs both BOSH and WebSocket connections will use their secure\n *  variants if the current connection to the site is also secure (https).\n *\n *  BOSH options:\n *  -------------\n *\n *  By adding \"sync\" to the options, you can control if requests will\n *  be made synchronously or not. The default behaviour is asynchronous.\n *  If you want to make requests synchronous, make \"sync\" evaluate to true.\n *  > var conn = new Strophe.Connection(\"/http-bind/\", {sync: true});\n *\n *  You can also toggle this on an already established connection.\n *  > conn.options.sync = true;\n *\n *  The *customHeaders* option can be used to provide custom HTTP headers to be\n *  included in the XMLHttpRequests made.\n *\n *  The *keepalive* option can be used to instruct Strophe to maintain the\n *  current BOSH session across interruptions such as webpage reloads.\n *\n *  It will do this by caching the sessions tokens in sessionStorage, and when\n *  \"restore\" is called it will check whether there are cached tokens with\n *  which it can resume an existing session.\n *\n *  The *withCredentials* option should receive a Boolean value and is used to\n *  indicate wether cookies should be included in ajax requests (by default\n *  they're not).\n *  Set this value to true if you are connecting to a BOSH service\n *  and for some reason need to send cookies to it.\n *  In order for this to work cross-domain, the server must also enable\n *  credentials by setting the Access-Control-Allow-Credentials response header\n *  to \"true\". For most usecases however this setting should be false (which\n *  is the default).\n *  Additionally, when using Access-Control-Allow-Credentials, the\n *  Access-Control-Allow-Origin header can't be set to the wildcard \"*\", but\n *  instead must be restricted to actual domains.\n *\n *  The *contentType* option can be set to change the default Content-Type\n *  of \"text/xml; charset=utf-8\", which can be useful to reduce the amount of\n *  CORS preflight requests that are sent to the server.\n *\n *  Parameters:\n *    (String) service - The BOSH or WebSocket service URL.\n *    (Object) options - A hash of configuration options\n *\n *  Returns:\n *    A new Strophe.Connection object.\n */\nStrophe.Connection = function (service, options) {\n    // The service URL\n    this.service = service;\n    // Configuration options\n    this.options = options || {};\n    var proto = this.options.protocol || \"\";\n\n    // Select protocal based on service or options\n    if (service.indexOf(\"ws:\") === 0 || service.indexOf(\"wss:\") === 0 ||\n            proto.indexOf(\"ws\") === 0) {\n        this._proto = new Strophe.Websocket(this);\n    } else {\n        this._proto = new Strophe.Bosh(this);\n    }\n\n    /* The connected JID. */\n    this.jid = \"\";\n    /* the JIDs domain */\n    this.domain = null;\n    /* stream:features */\n    this.features = null;\n\n    // SASL\n    this._sasl_data = {};\n    this.do_session = false;\n    this.do_bind = false;\n\n    // handler lists\n    this.timedHandlers = [];\n    this.handlers = [];\n    this.removeTimeds = [];\n    this.removeHandlers = [];\n    this.addTimeds = [];\n    this.addHandlers = [];\n    this.protocolErrorHandlers = {\n        'HTTP': {},\n        'websocket': {}\n    };\n\n    this._idleTimeout = null;\n    this._disconnectTimeout = null;\n\n    this.authenticated = false;\n    this.connected = false;\n    this.disconnecting = false;\n    this.do_authentication = true;\n    this.paused = false;\n    this.restored = false;\n\n    this._data = [];\n    this._uniqueId = 0;\n\n    this._sasl_success_handler = null;\n    this._sasl_failure_handler = null;\n    this._sasl_challenge_handler = null;\n\n    // Max retries before disconnecting\n    this.maxRetries = 5;\n\n    // Call onIdle callback every 1/10th of a second\n    // XXX: setTimeout should be called only with function expressions (23974bc1)\n    this._idleTimeout = setTimeout(function() {\n        this._onIdle();\n    }.bind(this), 100);\n\n    utils.addCookies(this.options.cookies);\n    this.registerSASLMechanisms(this.options.mechanisms);\n\n    // initialize plugins\n    for (var k in Strophe._connectionPlugins) {\n        if (Strophe._connectionPlugins.hasOwnProperty(k)) {\n            var ptype = Strophe._connectionPlugins[k];\n            // jslint complaints about the below line, but this is fine\n            var F = function () {}; // jshint ignore:line\n            F.prototype = ptype;\n            this[k] = new F();\n            this[k].init(this);\n        }\n    }\n};\n\nStrophe.Connection.prototype = {\n    /** Function: reset\n     *  Reset the connection.\n     *\n     *  This function should be called after a connection is disconnected\n     *  before that connection is reused.\n     */\n    reset: function () {\n        this._proto._reset();\n\n        // SASL\n        this.do_session = false;\n        this.do_bind = false;\n\n        // handler lists\n        this.timedHandlers = [];\n        this.handlers = [];\n        this.removeTimeds = [];\n        this.removeHandlers = [];\n        this.addTimeds = [];\n        this.addHandlers = [];\n\n        this.authenticated = false;\n        this.connected = false;\n        this.disconnecting = false;\n        this.restored = false;\n\n        this._data = [];\n        this._requests = [];\n        this._uniqueId = 0;\n    },\n\n    /** Function: pause\n     *  Pause the request manager.\n     *\n     *  This will prevent Strophe from sending any more requests to the\n     *  server.

Class implements <tt>LoggerTransport</tt>\n * and thus can be added as global transport in order to capture all the logs.\n *\n * It captures subsequent log lines created whenever <tt>Logger</tt> logs\n * a message and stores them in a queue in order to batch log entries. There are\n * time and size limit constraints which determine how often batch entries are\n * stored. Whenever one of these limits is exceeded the <tt>LogCollector</tt>\n * will use the <tt>logStorage</tt> object given as an argument to save\n * the batch log entry.\n *\n * @param {Object} logStorage an object which allows to store the logs collected\n * @param {function(string|object[])} logStorage.storeLogs a method called when\n * this <tt>LogCollector</tt> requests log entry storage. The method's argument\n * is an array which can contain <tt>string</tt>s and <tt>object</tt>s. If given\n * item is an object it means that it's an aggregated message. That is a message\n * which is the same as the previous one and it's representation has\n * the following format:\n * {\n *   {string} text: 'the text of some duplicated message'\n *   {number} count: 3 // how many times the message appeared in a row\n * }\n * If a message \"B\" after an aggregated message \"A\" is different, then it breaks\n * the sequence of \"A\". Which means that even if the next message \"C\" is\n * the same as \"A\" it will start a new aggregated message \"C\".\n * @param {function()} logStorage.isReady a method which should return\n * a <tt>boolean</tt> to tell the collector that it's ready to store. During the\n * time storage is not ready log batches will be cached and stored on the next\n * occasion (flush or interval timeout).\n *\n * @param {Object} options the <tt>LogCollector</tt> configuration options.\n * @param {number} options.maxEntryLength the size limit for a single log entry\n * to be stored. The <tt>LogCollector</tt> will push the entry as soon as it\n * reaches or exceeds this limit given that <tt>logStorage.isReady</tt>\n * returns <tt>true</tt>. Otherwise the log entry will be cached until the log\n * storage becomes ready. Note that the \"is ready\" condition is checked every\n * <tt>options.storeInterval</tt> milliseconds.\n * @param {number} options.storeInterval how often the logs should be stored in\n * case <tt>maxEntryLength</tt> was not exceeded.\n * @param {boolean} options.stringifyObjects indicates whether or not object\n * arguments should be \"stringified\" with <tt>JSON.stringify</tt> when a log\n * message is composed.
